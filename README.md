## To be or not to be?

**IMPORTANT: using a loot filter MAY get your account BANNED by Blizzard!**

### Why you want to use it

- According to some [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/qedwxg/d2r_loot_filter_not_bannable/), Blizzard Korean community is more encouraged to use `mpq` based loot filters.
- MPQ based mods are officially supported, and it uses Blizzard's own launcher. Battle.net doesn't reject the MPQ we are loading.
- No memory detection and injection are used, everything is visual change.
- The official loot display is terrible.

### Why you don't want to use it

- Loot filter in D2R in theory could allow you to click faster than players who don't use it, which puts you in an advanced situation.
- It's Blizzard. They always ban players. I got my Diablo 3 account banned for a stupid hellfire amulet exploit that I just tried for 5 minutes which literally hurt nobody at all. If you play their games, you are always at risk.
- If you live in China, you don't say bad things about Xi Jinping; if you play Blizzard's games, you don't mod your game. It's the same idea.

## How to install / load a mod

### Installation

- Clone this repo, or download as zip & extract it.
- Go to your d2r folder (try to find `Diablo 2 Resurrected` under a default location, `C:\Program Files\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)`).
- Create `mods\MOD_NAME` folders, e.g. `mods\givemhell`.
- Copy an `mpq` folder, e.g. `givemhell.mpq` to the folder you created above.

Now you should have some folder structures like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo 2 Resurrected\mods\givemhell\givemhell.mpq` and a bunch of files inside it.

### Loading

- Go to Battle.net or Diablo 2 Resurrected launcher, go to D2R, and edit game settings (next to "Play" button).
- Add `-mod givemhell -txt` as "command line argument".

After launching the game, all your settings are reset, including options, custom key bindings etc.
